				<strong><font size="2">&nbsp;TIPS FOR FAMILY AND 
				FRIENDS</font><br>
				by Martha Oakes, Postpartum AyurDoula</strong>
				<p>After the delivery of a baby, the digestive power is often 
				diminished; a new mother’s digestive system is very delicate. 
				Yet her needs are great. Choice of foods and how well a mother 
				digests her food has a great deal to do with the quality of her 
				milk, avoiding depression and colic, and the quality of mom’s 
				rejuvenation, strength, comfort, and resulting spontaneous and 
				natural expression of mothering. The following suggestions are 
				time tested, from the ancient system of natural health care 
				called Ayurveda, and found common to many cultures around the 
				world as well!</p>
				<p>Try adapting your family favorites and refrigerator on-hands 
				(no leftovers please, because of pretty guaranteed gas for mom 
				and baby by next day!) to using the preferred veggies, 
				seasonings, grains, sweets and proteins. <b>Use ample oiliness, 
				moisture, warmth, and of course, love.</b> She will feel it all.</p>
				<p>Please use suggested seasonings too! We need <b>all six 
				tastes</b> in our main meals for balanced nutrition, but at this 
				time emphasize sweet, sour and some salt with a little of the 
				others. Herbs and spices help digestion, often lactation as 
				well. Mom and baby have much inner and quiet work to do right 
				now which has such long lasting effect on her well being and 
				family life. And on ours too. So little adjustments tend to make 
				a really big difference at this time in their lives.</p>
				<p><strong>Preferred Foods</strong></p>
				<p><b>There are lots of yummy things you can do with this list!</b></p>
				<p><b>Pure water, warm, oily, liquid or moist, nourishing, 
				delicious, gentle on the digestion. Fresh ingredients freshly 
				prepared by a happy cook – these have better life force and 
				maternal/infant results!</b></p>
				<p><b>Proteins to favor</b> are <b>boiled</b> warm milk (see our
				<a href="http://www.sacredwindow.com/node/42">article about milk</a>) 
				and ricotta, cottage and other unfermented cheeses; split hulled 
				mung beans in soup, perhaps other soaked overnight and 
				well-cooked lentils. Legumes combined with grain or (smaller 
				amount of) nuts or seeds gives a complete amino acid complement. 
				Rarely does tofu or fermented cheeses work; most women and their 
				babies have trouble with soy - and the hard to digest cheeses. 
				Non vegetarians do chicken and fish soups after about 4 weeks. 
				Lassi, a yogurt or buttermilk drink thinned half with water and 
				seasoned, sweet or savory. Almond or other nut milk; specially 
				nourishing among nuts and seeds are well soaked, (24 – 48 hours) 
				for snack, or prepared vegetables, grains, nut milks, soups, or 
				sauces. </p>
				<p><b>Carbohydrates</b> – Favor Basmati or white rices (cook 
				with an extra ½-1 cup water per cup of rice), unleavened wheat 
				such as couscous, pastas, sprouted grain “Essene” breads, and 
				chapatis (unleavened tortillas), tapioca without the egg, yams, 
				sweet/oiled winter squashes, oats, and quinoa or barley in 
				smaller quantity. Women who have been eating brown rice daily 
				may be fine with it, but is somewhat rough/scraping or 
				constipating on tender bowels for most. Favor less refined 
				sugars - especially the iron rich ones like Succanat, the dark 
				Indian jaggery and molasses. <i>Do not <b>cook</b> with honey</i>.
				<b>Postpartum moms DO need healthy sweets, even if not 
				breastfeeding!</b>Sweet fresh (not chilled) and freshly squeezed 
				sweet fruit juices are wonderful for their life force. Coconut 
				milk is sweet, soothing and delicious in cream sauces or soups 
				too.</p>
				<p><b>Vegetables</b> – Cooked until softer, not just al dente – 
				Asparagus, beet, carrot, fresh dill, fresh fenugreek leaves (methi), 
				summer squashes, pumpkin, avocado, artichoke, chayote, okra. 
				Some green beans or broccoli well seasoned if she is not of thin 
				body type, and peeled eggplant, kale, spinach, or chard may also 
				be fine properly seasoned; Be sure to use oiliness, seasonings, 
				salt, and lime juice with leafy greens. </p>
				<p><b>Seasonings - </b>Basil, a little Black Mustard Seed, 
				Cumin, Caraway, Citrus Peel, Cardamom, Cinnamon, Fennel, 
				Fenugreek, Licorice Powder. Fresh Garlic...<b><i>prepared only 
				by mincing and browning in ghee, butter or sesame oil</i></b> 
				Ginger (fresh is often best, dry more drying and heating), 
				pinches of Hing (Asafoetida - instead of Onion), Lime, Orange or 
				Lemon juice and Peel, Marjoram, Nutmeg if she is not prone to 
				constipation. A little Black Pepper, Paprika, Tamarind, 
				Tarragon, Turmeric. Ajwan (wild celery) seeds soaked first in 
				cool water.</p>
				<p><b>Fats</b> - Use healthy fats and oils more abundantly than 
				normal, this is important for hormonal as well as rejuvenative 
				effects and more. Most particularly clarified butter, sesame and 
				toasted sesame oils, butter, coconut oil in the summer (it 
				cools), and some olive are the best ones, though clarified 
				butter (ghee) and coconut, a little sesame are the best for 
				cooking healthy. Please avoid hydrogenated or cooked vegetable 
				oils (trans-fatty acids)! And we get to forget the low-fat idea, 
				for health, emotional, hormonal, mental and physical, unless 
				medically advised otherwise such as from liver damage, alchohol 
				or gall bladder problems.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<center><b>Minimize these as best you can.</b></center>&nbsp;
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>Dry, cold, rough, harder to digest, heavy, clogging, 
				fermented foods and “rascally” pungent (spicy) tastes. At least 
				minimize these, best to just avoid.</b> These factors for 
				various reasons aggravate mother and/or infant digestion, can 
				accumulate into colic, or slow mom’s rejuvenation. Some are 
				bigger no-no's than others. <b>Rushed or irritated atmosphere in 
				cooking, serving, and eating also weakens digestion, hence 
				maternal/infant tummy discomfort.</b></p>
				<p><b>Most of us know about these</b> – Coffee, sodas, 
				chocolate, alcohol, garlic (dry, raw, or undercooked); onion, 
				radish, chilies, cabbage family.</p>
				<p><b>Cold Foods and Drinks</b> – yup, like ice cream and salads 
				and chilled foods and drinks in general.</p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left: 3.75pt; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px">
				<b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Heavies</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
				– such as red meats and fermented cheeses, cold homogenized and 
				pasteurized non-organic milk, sour cream, yogurt, lotsa nuts, 
				eggs, and fried foods (sauté is ok).</font></span></p>

				<b><br>
				<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Dried foods</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
				– Rule of thumb is those obviously taking moisture out of the 
				system to digest, like dried fruits, crackers, toast! These &amp; 
				rough dryer grains (millet, brown rice, corn, buckwheat) can be 
				hard on your fragile digestion. Less white potatoes as well as 
				drying, bitter, and astringent herbs (even frequent chamomile, 
				red zinger and red raspberry), and watch out for the legumes - 
				heavy gas producers.&nbsp; 2 – 3 cups of strong Sage or Turmeric tea 
				is extreme enough it is used by midwives to dry up lactation.&nbsp; 
				Balance with oil, moist, sweet, sour, salty tastes and 
				influences if you can't avoid.</font></span></p>

				Easy also on Leafy Greens first weeks, and other 
				bitter/astringent foods. But greens are so high in iron and bone 
				flexibility minerals (especially the stems for the latter), if 
				they sound good to Mom, balance them with oiliness, salt, fennel 
				or cumin or caraway or dill, and ginger or roasted garlic or 
				hing, lime, and some sweeter vegetable as well.</font></span></p>

		<li class="faqaq"><a name="What_is_a_doula">What is a doula?</a>
		<p class="faqaa">Doula is a Greek word for Woman who helps women. She 
		offers natural motherly and practical physical and emotional support, 
		and often has had training and certification for her work. She may be a 
		birth and/or a postpartum doula, or even serve pregnant women on bed 
		rest or at other times in their lives when they need basic help at home 
		due to some handicap.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">&nbsp; </li>
		<li class="faqaq"><a name="What_is_a_birth_doula">What is a birth doula?</a><br>
		&nbsp;
		<p class="faqaa">Some of our AyurDoulas are also birth doulas. Certified 
		doulas taken at least 2 – 3 days training and done their practicum 
		requirements to receive their credential, usually from DONA or CAPPA. A 
		birth doula begins by providing information about your birth options and 
		assisting with writing your birth plan. If you feel comfortable with 
		her, she becomes your professional labor assistant offering physical and 
		emotional support through labor. She is not a midwife, but your personal 
		assistant through the birth.
		<ul class="plainlist">
			<li class="plainlist">We usually meet 2 or 3 times before the birth. 
			</li>
			<li class="plainlist">We can help ease your transition from home to 
			hospital. </li>
			<li class="plainlist">We are trained to provide comfort measures to 
			ease and deal with pain. </li>
			<li class="plainlist">We will stay by your side throughout your 
			labor and birth as desired. </li>
			<li class="plainlist">We can assist or relieve your spouse or 
			companion in their role. </li>
			<li class="plainlist">Research also shows a more positive birth 
			experience, and mothers and babies bond better. </li>
			<li class="plainlist">We come to your home about a week after the 
			birth for a follow-up visit. </li>

		<a name="How_do_I_know_it_will_be_worth_the_extra_expense">How do I know 
		it will be worth the extra expense?</a><br>
		&nbsp;
		<p class="faqaa">Having a Birth Doula has been statistically measured to 
		offer the following:
		<ul class="plainlist">
			<li class="plainlist">60% Reduction in Epidural requests </li>
			<li class="plainlist">50% Reduction in Cesarean Rate </li>
			<li class="plainlist">40% Reduction in Oxytocin Use </li>

		<li class="faqaq"><a name="What_is_a_postpartum_doula">What is a 
		postpartum doula?</a><br>
		&nbsp;
		<p class="faqaa">Postpartum doulas go into the home and help for the 
		first few weeks with breast feeding, newborn care and instruction, 
		mother care, offer resources and give general family, breastfeeding, 
		kitchen, light household support and community resources. A postpartum 
		doula has 2 to 3 days class training plus documented practical 
		experience according to her certifying organization, usually DONA or 
		CAPPA.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">&nbsp; </li>
		<li class="faqaq"><a name="What_is_an_AyurDoula">What is an AyurDoula?</a><br>
		&nbsp;
		<p class="faqaa">A postpartum AyurDoula has a minimum of 120 class and 
		internship hours training with many more hours practice, study and 
		testing. She serves the role of a postpartum doula and more - she 
		understands much that mothers of many older cultures used to know, and 
		all mothers should understand. These are simple and natural principles 
		involved in restoring strength, vitality and balance in maternal and 
		infant physiology after childbirth.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">She understands the unfortunately little known dietary 
		and lifestyle choices which can minimize or avoid colic and depression, 
		as well as many other common discomforts, and will be available to guide 
		you as you are willing to make your best choices. She is trained in the 
		arts of Ayurvedic Mother and Infant warm oil treatments (like simple, 
		soothing massage), cooking for postpartum mothers, and may have 
		experience with a few key safe postpartum herbal and essential oils uses 
		to enhance your comfort and rejuvenation.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">Above all, she offers her TLC like any doula or other 
		mother for your ease, comfort and happiness. And she also has limits to 
		what she can learn even in the AyurDoula advanced training program, and 
		knows herself as part of a greater network of health practitioners, both 
		your doctor or midwife and others trained in perinatal and specifically 
		Ayurvedic work.</p>

		What do you mean by 42 Days for 42 Years?</a><br>
		&nbsp;
		<p class="faqaa">According to the 6,000 year old medical texts in 
		Ayurveda by Sushrut, we women are in a very special window for 42 days 
		after childbirth, extended by 10 days to 2 weeks more if there is 
		surgery (yes, they had very good surgical technique then if needed)</p>
		<p class="faqaa">They say that we are psycho-physiologically as delicate 
		as our babies during this time, even if we can muster all kinds of 
		will-power (oh my, can we), know-how, coordination, and devoted loving 
		service. We are naturally led by our hearts in service often even when 
		we are <span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Verdana">totally</span> 
		overwhelmed.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">After childbirth we have LOTS of invisible work to do! 
		And it is our biological mandate, our own Mother Nature’s program we 
		could say, to restructure our whole physiology in the direction of 
		greater ability to love and serve, if we give it the chance.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">This is why so many cultures have similar traditions to 
		what we are trained in.&nbsp; And why they say choices now are perhaps more 
		significant than any other time in our lives, for our ability to mother, 
		partner, and serve our world for the next 42 years! It is also about how 
		long it takes food to convert from initial digestion to all the tissues 
		in the regenerative process. For the subtlest and deepest tissues, the 
		reproductive, it takes up to 42 days – from eating a meal to 
		rejuvenating that tissue … </p>

		What</strong></a><strong> can I expect with a
		<a href="http://www.sacredwindow.com/node/53">consultation</a> over the 
		phone?</strong><br>
		&nbsp;
		<p class="faqaa">It depends upon your request and need, based upon a 
		question and answer dialog about your experience, lifestyle, 
		constitution, imbalances, and habits and how they relate to the known 
		natural imbalances and needs of childbearing written about in the 
		Ayurvedic textbooks for over 6,000 years. We can share ideas found 
		valuable for so many of our clients, various 
		body/emotional/mind/supportive measures you can do yourself or choose to 
		do with a little help.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">These ideas are used around the world by cultures which 
		don't have problems postpartum, and are often very easily understood and 
		used yourself to maximize your recovery from your birth. These tips are 
		based upon my experience with postpartum mothers as well as about using 
		therapeutic grade essential oils and on my Ayurvedic training of course 
		and experience as mother of two wonderful children &amp; 2 grandchildren. I 
		will also offer if you wish which essential oils or other herbs I might 
		use if it were me and possibly discuss specific herbals known to support 
		your situation safely in some possible formula specific to these 
		considerations. I cannot however presume to replace the advice of your 
		physician or midwife, only to perhaps supplement it.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">If we schedule your appointment right, I can call you 
		back no charge to you on long distance. Email or call me with a few 
		options for your best time to talk and I'll get back with you as soon as 
		I can. You can pay by Pay Pal or mail a check. Rate is still posted 
		$60/hour although to my astonishment, someone who overheard me doing a 
		consult, who worked for years for a well known Ayurvedic doctor, 
		informed me I should be charging $150/hour for the level of service

		<p class="faqaa">Please visit our CARE page where you will see many

		resources. And remember, this is not about selfish pampering! The value 
		of a mother’s well being is well researched to impact her family health 
		and happiness in a baby’s first hours, months, and 2—3 years. The 
		easiest time to influence it is immediately postpartum, when heart and 
		body are so open and biologically guided to restore at deepest levels in 
		loving service.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">Take a look again at the discussions under “42 Days for 
		42 Years” above, and the Benefits of AyurDoula care. Choices now are 
		significant for a long time to come, more than maybe any other time in 
		your life.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">If you are at all familiar with the costs of postpartum 
		depression alone, consider this. There are possible complications of 
		initial medications which are not safe for breastfeeding, giving the 
		major hurdle of pumping and relactation, or letting go of this sacred 
		opportunity for your baby’s health as well as yours.</p>
		<p class="faqaa">PPD Costs commonly include both time and expense for 
		medical and psychological visits, physical and emotional health issues 
		for over a year and maybe years on antidepressants with their frequent 
		side effects (and the major challenges in getting off them. For such 
		options please contact us for referrals and go to www.drugawareness.org</p>
		<p class="faqaa">Postpartum rejuvenation expenses include many problems 
		regarding weight, joints, reproductive health, hormones including 
		thyroid, digestive health and relationship health. 40% of divorcing men

				<strong>WHAT THE MOTHERS/DOULA CLIENTS SAY</strong><br>
				<span style="color: black">
				<font style="line-height: 1.35em" face="Arial" size="2">I was 
				two months from 44 when I had my son (first child). During my 
				six weeks of postpartum I experienced virtually none of the 
				problems that I heard about – fatigue, depression, or the 
				frustration and over-whelmed ness of being a new mother.&nbsp; I 
				believe that the results of the Ayurvedic Mother and Baby 
				Program are phenomenal.&nbsp; I would highly recommend this program 
				for mothers of any age, and I feel it is a necessity for older 
				mothers.”&nbsp; <em>-- Portia, School Teacher</em><br>
				<br>
				</font></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana">
				<font style="line-height: 1.35em" face="Arial" size="2">
				<font size="2">“After an extremely difficult labor and delivery 
				complication, this gentle and rejuvenating program was a real 
				blessing.&nbsp; The fatigue and strain melted away with the massage, 
				foods, essential oils, and herbs.&nbsp; This program allowed me to 
				become the mother I wanted to be – rested, energetic, loving, 
				and flexible.”</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>-- Marie, Meditation Teacher.</em><br>

				was depressed for months and had difficulty sleeping even when I 
				had the time.&nbsp; I didn’t feel clear or energetic, and my immune 
				system was also low for over a year.&nbsp; I was exhausted for a long 
				time.&nbsp; But with my second baby, because of the Maharishi 
				Ayur-Ved Mother and Baby Program, I feel normal and clear.&nbsp; The 
				herbs and massage make all the difference for my ability to rest 
				well and mother well.&nbsp; And the food is so delicious! I am 
				learning new cooking methods and recipes.”&nbsp;<em>-- Lynn, College

				<font style="line-height: 1.35em" face="Arial" size="2"><br>
				“At 6 weeks postpartum, I was looking at the pills in my 
				medicine cabinet and wondering how many it would take.&nbsp; I’ve 
				been a recovering alcoholic for 15 years, and I knew I needed to 
				find help.&nbsp; With less than 6 days of concentrated care, I felt 
				so much better; the memory of the previous week was like years 
				had passed.&nbsp; My doulas gave me daily a deeply soothing warm oil 
				Ayurvedic massage and applied organic essential oils which 
				really turned my emotions around.&nbsp; Their consulting doctor, an 
				Ayurvedic physician and MD, designed a special herbal formula 
				suitable for my liver damage. They cooked delicious, specially 
				designed meals for me and my family.&nbsp; They also educated my 
				family and friends and helped me create and accept a supportive 
				network. At six months postpartum, I am very healthy and happy, 
				living a normal life.”<em>-- Colorado Mother</em><br>

				Physician</em><br>
				<br>
				</font>&quot;My bowels used to move once or twice a week, and I had 
				tried everything.&nbsp; I was so sure it was impossible to change, I 
				argued with my AyurDoula about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a day of starting 
				the massage, essential oils, herbs, and delicious suitable 
				meals, my body responded, and continued.&nbsp; I sleep much better 
				too, and the Mother and Baby Program has made such a difference 
				for me with both of my babies in my ability to mother.”&nbsp;<em>--

				&quot;This program is soothing, rejuvenating, and makes me feel happy

				“I couldn’t afford the in home doula care services, so I bought

				month before I was due and organized a Blessing Way party. I 
				didn’t think I needed a baby shower as I still had clothes from 
				my first baby. There was such wonderful sharing, feelings, and 
				community created.&nbsp; My friends organized meals, child care, 
				dishes, laundry and errands, and gave me several massages, as
